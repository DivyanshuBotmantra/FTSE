            34   FTSE ALL-SHARE INDEX FUND


            FTSE All-Share Index Fund


              Investment Objective


              The Fund aims to track the performance of the FTSE All-Share Index (the “Index”) before the deduction of charges and tax.


              Investment Policy*


              The Index represents the performance of all shares on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, as defined by the


              Index provider.


              The Fund may invest in different types of derivatives for efficient portfolio management, including hedging. In particular


              the Fund may use derivatives to help it manage cash flows and dividend payments with the aim of generating returns


              that are consistent with the Index. The use of derivatives will be consistent with the risk profile of the Fund.


              Investment Strategy*


              The Fund will invest in a representative sample of the shares (equities) of companies that make up the Index and


              possibly some securities that are not included in the Index that are designed to help the Fund track the performance


              of the Index.


              The Fund may not invest in all the companies of the Index to manage transaction costs or to reflect market conditions,


              regulations or HSBC’s banned weapons policy.


              The Fund may hold cash and other funds, including funds managed by the HSBC Group, to manage day-to-day cash


              flow requirements.


              The Fund’s performance is measured against the Index, because the Fund intends to track the performance of the Index.


              *For details of the full Investment Policy and Strategy please refer to the HSBC Index Tracker Investment Funds


              prospectus. We have also published a Glossary of key terms used which you may wish to refer to. Both documents


              can be found at https://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk/en/individual-investor/fund-centre.


              Portfolio Activity


              The FTSE All-Share Index was up circa 13.0% during the reporting period. The FTSE-All Share Index is an aggregation


              of the FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap indices, with the first two indices representing over 90% of the total


              Index weight. Hence, the performance of the FTSE 100 and 250 explain most of the performance of the FTSE All Share.


              Industrials, Financials and Energy were the best performing sectors, while Consumer Staples mildly weighed on returns.


              UK equities fell early in the reporting period, as markets faced several headwinds in the form of falling energy and


              commodity prices, a strong Sterling which impacted export-based companies, and hawkish sentiment from the Bank of


              England (BoE). Conversely, UK equities performed well in Q3 2023, buoyed by a surge in oil prices and Sterling weakness


              against the US dollar, as inflation showed signs of easing through the quarter. The BoE’s decision to keep rates on hold


              in September surprised markets, and ended a 14-session streak of rate hikes. UK equities rose over the fourth quarter,


              boosted by a huge cross-asset rally in everything in November and December. Small- and mid-cap equities outperformed


              large-caps (which also rose), as a strong Sterling weighed on returns of larger companies. While GDP data in February


              confirmed a technical recession in H2 2023, consequent macro data releases were relatively upbeat, suggesting that the


              recession was shallow. More recently, GDP data for Q1 beat expectations, confirming the UK economy has moved out


              of a technical recession. The UK seems to be bottoming out and with inflationary pressures under control, we could see


              rate cuts materialise in line with expectations, although there is uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of the rate path.


              Resurgent wage growth could delay rate cuts and pose challenges for earnings.

              Investment Performance


              During the year under review, the value of the shares in the Fund increased by 12.57% while the value of the FTSE


              All-Share Index rose by 12.98%.

              which is a single price.)


              Please note that the above information refers to the past and that past performance is not a reliable indication


              of future returns.


              Tracking Error


              Tracking error - 0.06%


              The tracking error is based on gross returns from our internal performance system using closing valuations for the


              period to 30.04.24.


              We manage our Index funds with two equally important objectives - (1) close Index tracking and (2) minimising transaction


              costs. As a result of broader market dynamics tracking error has been slightly elevated over the first half of the year


              primarily due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, where stocks linked to Russia were deleted from the Index


              (Evraz PLC and Polymetal PLC) but these positions were divested prior to Index deletion. Also, broader equity market


              volatility has impacted tracking error as a result of hawkish central bank messaging and action. The tracking error of the


              FTSE All-Share Index Fund was broadly in line with expectations.

                Portfolio transaction costs are incurred by the Fund when buying and selling underlying investments. These costs vary


                depending on the class of investment, country of exchange and method of execution.


                These costs can be classified as either direct or indirect transaction costs:


                     Direct transaction costs: Broker commissions, fees and taxes.


                     Indirect transaction costs: ‘Dealing spread’ – the difference between the buying and selling prices of the


                     Fund’s underlying investments.


                In order to protect existing investors from the effects of dilution, portfolio transaction costs incurred as a re ult of


                investors buying and selling shares in the Fund are recovered from those investors through a ‘dilution adjustment’ to the


                price they pay or receive.

            18. Fair Value of Investments


                FRS 102 requires an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of


                the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy shall have the following classifications:


                Level 1:      unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at


                              the measurement date.


                Level 2:      inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable (i.e. developed using market


                              data) for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.


                Level 3:      inputs are unobservable (i.e. for which market data is unavailable) for the asset or liability.

            19. Sensitivity Analysis


                Price risk sensitivity:


                If the price of investments at 15 May 2024 had increased or decreased by 10% with all other variables held constant, this


                would have increased or decreased the net assets attributable to shareholders by £229,371,414 (15.5.23: £218,116,758).


                Currency risk sensitivity:


                If the exchange rate at 15 May 2024 had increased or decreased by 10% with all other variables held constant, this would


                have increased or decreased the net assets attributable to shareholders by £745,718 (15.5.23: £632,786).


                Interest rate risk sensitivity:


                 At the balance sheet date, the Fund did not have a significant exposure to interest rate risk, therefore no sensitivity


                analysis is disclosed (15.5.23: no significant exposure).
